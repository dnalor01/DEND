# SPARKIFY RELATIONAL DATABASE PROJECT OVERVIEW


## Project Goal:

This project extracts user and song information from a directory containing two datasets to allow easy analysis for Sparkify
workers to gain insights regarding user activity.

## Data Model:

A Star Schema model is implemented with the song_plays table serving as the fact table.

## Contents:

This notebook contains the forementioned directory as well as six files, including this README.

The remaining files contain SQL and Python code used to perform functions such as creating/dropping tables and 
creating ETL processes interspersed with markdown to aid understanding.
